Shopping System for E-businesses

This project is an online shopping system in which the buyers can order products they want, while sellers can input details about the products they want to sell such as product image, product name, price, available stocks, etc.. 

The platform that will be used in creating this program is PHPStorm and XAMPP to enable localhost website. 
Step/Procedure of the program:

Buyer Point of View:
1. The system will open the login page and ask the user to enter username and password.
2. The user can select if they want to register by clicking the register button or if the system does not recognize the user or the username/password is incorrect, the user will then be directed to the registration form page. 
3. After successfully logging in, the system will lead to the home page where the details about the sellers and the best selling products of the seller is displayed as default when entering.
4. In the main window, the user can select options like to go to the products page, about seller page, change password page, cart page, order history page, or log out.
5.In the product page, the user can select items they want to buy by clicking the add button. This will then be added to the cart page. The user can also remove items in their carts by clicking the remove button. The product page also has buttons for their specific categories for the buyer to easily navigate the products they are looking for. 
6. In the about seller page, the user can see the details about the user’s company and such.
7. In the settings page, the user can change password by typing the previous password,  enter the new password and confirm the current password. 
8. In the order history page, the user can check the items they had purchased. 

	
Seller/Admin Point of View:
1. The system will open PHPmyadmin, an open source tool for managing the sql and databases, to login to the system’s seller point of view in order to manage the inventory of the business website and as well be able to check the user accounts. 

2. After successfully logging in to the PHPmyadmin, the user can check from time to time if they are out of stocks or not. In this part, the seller can use functions such as add, edit, delete, and search for the products they sell in order to maintain a cleaner database. Additionally, the user can also edit accounts of the user from the buyer's point of view.
